# 👋 Hey, I'm Ahmad Ansar

**Aspiring Security Engineer @ Wentworth Institute of Technology**  
**Cybersecurity Intern @ State Street** · **SkillsUSA Cybersecurity Competitor**

I’m building hands-on skills in **network security, Linux, and Python**. I like small, practical projects with clear outcomes—things that make systems harder to break and easier to monitor.
