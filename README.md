# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmad Ansar

**Aspiring Security Engineer @ Wentworth Institute of Technology**  
**Cybersecurity Intern @ State Street** · **SkillsUSA Cybersecurity Competitor**

I build practical security projects with **Linux, Python, and networking**. I like small, useful tools and clear write-ups that make systems harder to break and easier to monitor.
